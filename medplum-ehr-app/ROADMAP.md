## Implementation Notes

### Priority Levels
- **High:** Critical path features required for core functionality
- **Medium:** Important features that enhance user experience
- **Low:** Nice-to-have features that can be deferred if needed

### Person-Centered Principles
Throughout all phases, maintain focus on these principles:
1. Patient preferences and values are central to all decisions
2. Care is coordinated and integrated
3. Information is accessible and understandable to patients
4. Emotional support is recognized and addressed
5. Family and friends are involved per patient preference
6. Care transitions are smooth and well-coordinated
7. Access to care is prioritized and barriers are reduced

### Dependencies
- Medplum server setup and configuration
- Authentication system implementation (Phase 1) is a prerequisite for most features
- Core patient management (Phase 1) is required for clinical features
- FHIR resource models must be defined before implementing resource-specific features

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- UI Components: Medplum React + Mantine
- State Management: React Context and Hooks
- Data Model: FHIR R4
- API: Medplum API Client
- Authentication: Medplum Auth with MFA support
