## Update Procedures

### Minor Updates (Patch Versions)

For minor updates (e.g., v4.0.0 to v4.0.1):

1. **Preparation**
   - Review the Medplum changelog for the update
   - Create a feature branch for the update
   - Update Medplum dependencies in package.json

   ```bash
   npm install @medplum/core@4.0.1 @medplum/fhirtypes@4.0.1 @medplum/react@4.0.1
   ```

2. **Testing**
   - Run all automated tests
   - Verify that all critical workflows function as expected
   - Check for any performance regressions

3. **Deployment**
   - Use the `deploy-frontend.sh` script created during Phase 6
   - Deploy to staging environment first
   - Monitor for issues before proceeding to production

   ```bash
   ./ehr-frontend/deployment/deploy-frontend.sh --env=staging
   ```

4. **Verification**
   - Run smoke tests against the staging environment
   - Verify all key functionality works as expected
   - Check logs for any new errors

### Major Updates (Minor or Major Versions)

For major updates (e.g., v4.0.x to v4.1.0 or v5.0.0):

1. **Assessment**
   - Review the Medplum changelog thoroughly
   - Identify breaking changes and their impact
   - Create a detailed migration plan
   - Allocate sufficient time for testing and verification

2. **Implementation**
   - Create a dedicated feature branch
   - Make all necessary code changes to accommodate breaking changes
   - Update dependencies

3. **Testing**
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Conduct performance testing
   - Test all critical workflows manually
   - Verify all integrations function correctly

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to a staging environment
   - Conduct thorough verification
   - Schedule a maintenance window for production deployment
   - Consider a phased rollout (similar to Phase 6 approach)

5. **Post-Deployment**
   - Monitor system closely for 72 hours
   - Have a rollback plan ready
   - Update all documentation to reflect changes

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy

1. **Database Backups**
   - Automated daily backups of the Medplum database
   - Store backups for at least 30 days
   - Test restoration process quarterly

2. **Configuration Backups**
   - Version control for all configuration files
   - Backup environment variables and secrets
   - Document all configuration changes

3. **Application Backups**
   - Store deployment artifacts for each release
   - Keep multiple versions available for rollback

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Database Recovery**
   - Restore from the most recent backup
   - Verify data integrity after restore
   - Run validation tests

2. **Application Recovery**
   - Use the rollback script created during Phase 6
   - Specify the backup timestamp to restore

   ```bash
   ./ehr-frontend/deployment/rollback.sh --env=production --backup-id=YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
   ```

3. **Configuration Recovery**
   - Revert to the last known good configuration
   - Verify environment variables match documented values

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **System Health**
   - API response times
   - Error rates
   - Resource utilization
   - Database connection pool saturation

2. **User Experience**

   - Time to interactive
   - Client-side errors
   - Session duration

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Active users
