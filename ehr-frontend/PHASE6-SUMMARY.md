# Phase 6: Production Deployment - Summary

## Overview
Phase 6 focused on planning and executing the production deployment of the Medplum v4.0.0 migration. We've created a comprehensive deployment plan, rollback procedures, testing scripts, and communication templates to ensure a smooth transition to the new version.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Deployment Planning
- Created a detailed deployment plan document (`PHASE6-DEPLOYMENT-PLAN.md`)
- Outlined staged rollout strategy with canary, expanded, and full deployment stages
- Defined success criteria and monitoring requirements
- Established deployment scheduling template

### 2. Deployment Automation
- Developed deployment script for EHR frontend (`deploy-frontend.sh`) 
- Created environment-specific configuration management
- Implemented backup procedures for rollback safety
- Added post-deployment verification checks

### 3. Rollback Procedures
- Created comprehensive rollback script (`rollback.sh`)
- Defined rollback triggers and decision points
- Established backup management for previous versions
- Implemented validation of restored systems

### 4. Testing Framework
- Developed smoke test script for rapid deployment validation (`smoke-test.sh`)
- Created post-deployment verification checklist
- Integrated with Phase 5 test suite for pre-deployment validation
- Added health check monitoring

### 5. Communication Templates
- Created stakeholder notification template
- Developed deployment report template for post-deployment analysis
- Established communication channels and timelines

### 6. Monitoring and Verification
- Defined key health metrics to monitor during and after deployment
- Established monitoring schedule with progressive relaxation
- Created issue response protocol based on severity
- Developed structured approach to deployment sign-off

## Deployment Resources Created

1. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - `ehr-frontend/deployment/deploy-frontend.sh`
   - `ehr-frontend/deployment/rollback.sh`
   - `ehr-frontend/deployment/smoke-test.sh`

2. **Documentation**:
   - `ehr-frontend/PHASE6-DEPLOYMENT-PLAN.md`
   - `ehr-frontend/deployment/notification-template.md`
   - `ehr-frontend/deployment/post-deployment-checklist.md`
   - `ehr-frontend/deployment/deployment-report-template.md`

## Next Steps

With the successful completion of Phase 6 planning, the project is ready to proceed with:

1. **Scheduling the Production Deployment**:
   - Select appropriate maintenance window
   - Notify stakeholders according to communication plan
   - Prepare deployment team and support resources

2. **Execute Staged Rollout**:
   - Perform canary deployment and monitoring
   - Expand deployment according to plan
   - Complete full deployment with comprehensive verification

3. **Post-Deployment Activities**:
   - Complete deployment report
   - Conduct post-deployment review
   - Transition to Phase 7: Cleanup and Future-Proofing

## Conclusion

Phase 6 has established a robust foundation for the production deployment of Medplum v4.0.0. The careful planning, automation, and verification procedures will ensure a smooth transition with minimal user impact. The staged rollout approach provides multiple validation points and the ability to safely roll back if issues arise, making this a low-risk approach to the significant version upgrade.
