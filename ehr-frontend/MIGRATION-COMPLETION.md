## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- **Phased Approach**: Breaking the migration into distinct phases helped manage complexity
- **Incremental Updates**: Moving to v3.3.0 before v4.0.0 reduced risk
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite caught issues early
- **Documentation**: Thorough documentation facilitated knowledge sharing
- **Tool Development**: Custom tools streamlined migration and cleanup

### Challenges Encountered
- **Deprecated Methods**: Some deprecated methods required complex refactoring
- **Type Safety**: Stricter typing required more code changes than anticipated
- **Integration Points**: External integrations needed careful validation
- **Performance Tuning**: Some components required optimization after migration

### Best Practices for Future Migrations
- Start with comprehensive assessment and planning
- Establish robust testing before beginning migration
- Use incremental approach for major version upgrades
- Create detailed documentation throughout the process
- Develop automated tools to assist with migration tasks
- Conduct thorough testing at each stage

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Stay current with minor Medplum releases
2. **Continued Refactoring**: Further optimize components using v4.0.0 features
3. **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep documentation updated with changes
4. **Testing Enhancements**: Continue improving test coverage
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly monitor and optimize performance

## Conclusion

The successful migration to Medplum v4.0.0 has positioned our EHR Frontend application for improved performance, enhanced developer experience, and future growth. The structured approach, comprehensive testing, and thorough documentation have ensured a smooth transition and established a foundation for maintaining and evolving the application going forward.

The tools and processes developed during this migration will continue to provide value for ongoing maintenance and future upgrades, ensuring that our application remains current with the latest Medplum capabilities.
